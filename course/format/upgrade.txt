information provided here is intended especially for developers.
Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Course_formats

=== 12.5 ===

* Method create_course() will populate the new course with empty sections if $data->numsections is provided even if
  "numsections" is not an option defined by the course format.
* course/changenumsections.php can now be used to insert sections at any positions

=== 12 ===

* format_section_renderer_base::section_edit_control_menu() has changed
* format_section_renderer_base::section_edit_controls() has changed

=== 10 ===

* Course format may use the inplace_editable template to allow quick editing of section names, see
  https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Inplace_editable and MDL-51802 for example implementation.
* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* Course formats can overwrite get_default_course_enddate function to set the default course end date for new courses.
  format_base::get_default_course_enddate uses the new "Course duration" site setting to calculate the default course end date
  from the default course start date.
* New method format_base::supports_news() which is used to determine whether an Announcements forum will be automatically created on
  course creation. For course format plugin developers, please override format_base::supports_news() to return true if you want the
  Announcements forum to be created upon course creation and remove the block names defined in format_base::get_default_blocks().
