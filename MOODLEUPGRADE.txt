UPGRADING A MOODLE SITE TO TOTARA
=================================

These instructions detail the process for upgrading a Moodle site to Totara.

Totara migration requirements:

* Moodle 3.3.9 (Build: 20181112)
* Oracle database is not supported.
* MSSQL only: Database user requires additional permissions: ALTER SETTINGS(SERVER), full text search must be enabled.
* all other requirements listed in INSTALL.txt

NOTE: Additional plugins, custom themes or customised Moodle code are likely to
    cause conflicts in the upgrade process.
    Review possible conflicts before upgrading to prevent site stability issues.

    You can migrate to this Totara release only from one exact Moodle release
    specified above. If you are using lower Moodle version you must upgrade to
    the required Moodle release first.

    If the Moodle site you are upgrading from used oauth2 authentication plugin
    users created via this plugin will not be able to access the site after the
    upgrade. These accounts may be converted to manual accounts and users issued
    with a new passwords using password reset. If you require assistance to convert
    oauth2 users to manual accounts please contact Totara Support.

    For more information see http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading

    folder with the new moodle code folder and copy your old config.php file
    to the new folder.

6b. If you have customised moodle you will need to merge your existing Moodle
    source code and new Totara code. This is best accomplished using a version
    control tool like GIT or SVN. You will need to:
    - Reuse the existing Moodle's config.php file
    - Ensure any themes are updated to work with Totara
    - Include any existing modules and filters remain in the code
    - Resolve any merge conflicts caused by existing local customisations

15. Edit the New Site Settings page if required.

16. Test the site functionality. The site should now be displayed with the
    Totara logos and theme.
