Feature: Make sure course completion depending on completion of other course is checked on cron
  In order to ensure that course criteria are marked complete when dependent courses are completed
  I need to run the completion cron task and check that the courses were marked complete

  @javascript
  Scenario: Cron marks criteria complete based on completion of other course
    # Set up some data.
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname         | shortname | idnumber | category |
      | Dependent course | DC        | DC       | 0        |
      | Resulting course | RC        | RC       | 0        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student   | First    | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | student1 | DC     | student        |
      | student1 | RC     | student        |
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | enablecompletion | 1 |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following administration settings values:
      | Enable completion tracking | 1 |
    # Configure the dependent course's completion.
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Dependent course"
    And completion tracking is "Enabled" in current course
    And I follow "Course completion"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | criteria_self_value | 1 |
    And I press "Save changes"
    # Configure the resulting course's completion.
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Resulting course"
    And completion tracking is "Enabled" in current course
    And I follow "Course completion"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Courses available | Miscellaneous / Dependent course |
    And I press "Save changes"
    # Run cron to make sure the reaggregate flag is set to 0.
    And I run the scheduled task "core\task\completion_regular_task"
    # Import course completion for the dependent course.
    When I navigate to "Upload Completion Records" node in "Site administration > Courses > Upload Completion Records"
    And I set the field "Override current course completions" to "1"
    And I upload "completion/tests/fixtures/completion_criteria_course_cron.csv" file to "Choose course file to upload" filemanager
    And I click on "Upload" "button" in the "#mform1" "css_element"
    Then I should see "CSV import completed"
    And I should see "1 Records successfully imported as courses"
    # Check that the resulting course is NOT marked complete.
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Resulting course"
    And I navigate to "Course completion" node in "Course administration > Reports"
    And I should see "Not completed" in the "Student First" "table_row"
    # Run the function we're testing.
    And I run the scheduled task "core\task\completion_regular_task"
    # Check that the resulting course IS marked complete.
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Resulting course"
    And I navigate to "Course completion" node in "Course administration > Reports"
    And I should see "Completed" in the "Student First" "table_row"
