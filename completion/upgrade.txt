This file describes API changes in core completion,
information provided here is intended for developers.

=== 10 ===

* completion_completion->_save() now records the status as COMPLETION_STATUS_NOTYETSTARTED (10) when no timeenrolled,
  timestarted and timecompleted is provided. Previously, it resulted in status 0 which has no corresponding constant
  and is therefore invalid. Any customisations which rely on status 0 should be redesigned around this change.
