  Scenario: Test audience condition prevents student access
    # Basic setup.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on

    # Add a page.
    And I add a "Page" to section "1"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name         | Test Page 1      |
      | Description  | Some description |
      | Page content | page content     |
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Audience" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I click on ".availability-item .availability-eye" "css_element"
    And I set the field "Member of Audience" to "Audience1"
    And I press key "13" in the field "Member of Audience"
    And I press "Save and return to course"

    # Add a Page with a grade condition for 'any grade'.
    And I add a "Page" to section "2"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name         | Test Page 2            |
      | Description  | Some other description |
      | Page content | more page content      |
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Audience" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I click on ".availability-item .availability-eye" "css_element"
    And I set the field "Member of Audience" to "Audience2"
    And I press key "13" in the field "Member of Audience"

    # Log in as student
    When I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Course 1"

    Then I should see "Test Page 1" in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should not see "Test Page 2" in the "region-main" "region"
