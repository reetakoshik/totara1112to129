 * External functions that were returning file information now return the following additional file fields:
   - mimetype (the file mime type)
   - isexternalfile (if is a file reference to a external repository)
   - repositorytype (the repository name in case is a external file)
   Those fields are VALUE_OPTIONAL for backwards compatibility.

* Old /mod/MODULENAME/pix/icon.gif and enrol/paypal/pix/icon.gif GIF icons have been removed. Please use pix_icon
  renderable instead.
* Callback get_types() is deprecated, instead activity modules can define callback get_shortcuts().
  See source code for get_module_metadata().
* Dropped support for the $module in mod/xxx/version.php files (deprecated
  since 2.7). All activity modules must use the $plugin syntax now. See
  https://docs.moodle.org/dev/version.php for details (MDL-43896).
* Modules using rating component must implement a callback mod_x_rating_can_see_item_ratings(). Refer
  to mod_forum_rating_can_see_item_ratings() for example.

Functions may now be added to the lib.php file of any plugin that will be called each time
any course module create/update form is used. The functions to do this are as follows:
* To add form elements - (plugin_name)_coursemodule_standard_elements($formwrapper, $mform)
* To validate form elements - (plugin_name)_coursemodule_validation($formwrapper, $data)
* To perform actions after passing validation - (plugin_name)_coursemodule_edit_post_actions($data, $course)

* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* update_module_button() and core_renderer::update_module_button() have been deprecated and should not be used anymore.
  Activity modules should not add the edit module button, the link is already available in the Administration block.
  Themes can choose to display the link in the buttons row consistently for all module types.
* New callback check_updates_since available. Check if the module has any update that affects the current user since the given time.
  Please refer to mod/assign/lib.php, mod/forum/lib.php or mod/quiz/lib.php for sample code.
