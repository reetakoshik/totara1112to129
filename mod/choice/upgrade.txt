This files describes API changes in /mod/choice/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 12 ===

* mod_choice_renderer::display_publish_name_vertical() has changed
* mod_choice_external::delete_choice_responses has changed behaviour - if a teacher
  calls this function with no responses specified then only their own responses will
  be deleted, rather than all responses for all users within the choice.

=== 10 ===

* Events mod_choice\event\answer_submitted and mod_choice\event\answer_updated
  are no longer triggered. Observers listening to these events must instead listen
  to mod_choice\event\answer_created and mod_choice\event\answer_deleted that are
  triggered for each option that is selected or unselected. User whose choice was
  modified can be found in $event->relateduserid (this does not have to be the
  user who performs the action).
