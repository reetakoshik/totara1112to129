* Events mod_choice\event\answer_submitted and mod_choice\event\answer_updated
  are no longer triggered. Observers listening to these events must instead listen
  to mod_choice\event\answer_created and mod_choice\event\answer_deleted that are
  triggered for each option that is selected or unselected. User whose choice was
  modified can be found in $event->relateduserid (this does not have to be the
  user who performs the action).
