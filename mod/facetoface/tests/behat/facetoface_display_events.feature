Feature: Displaying seminar's events with settings overlapping
Background:
	Given the following "courses" exist:
		| fullname | shortname | category |
		| course1  | c101	   | 0		  |
	And the following "users" exist:
		| username | firstname | lastname | email 			|

	And the following "course enrolments" exist:
		| user  | course | role    |
		| bomba | c101	 | student |
	And I am on a totara site
	And I log in as "admin"
	And I am on "course1" course homepage with editing mode on
	And I add a "Seminar" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
		| Name 								   | Seminar 1 			 |
		| Description 						   | This is description |
		| Users can sign-up to multiple events | 1 					 |
		| Events displayed on course page	   | 2 					 |
	And I follow "Seminar 1"
	#Creating Event 1 - future event
	And I follow "Add a new event"
	And I click on "Save changes" "button"
	#Creating Event 2 - future event
	And I follow "Add a new event"
	And I click on "Save changes" "button"
	#Creating Event 3 - On going event
	And I follow "Add a new event"
	And I follow "Edit session"
	And I fill seminar session with relative date in form data:
		| sessiontimezone	 | Pacific/Auckland |
		| timestart[day] 	 | 0  				|
		| timestart[hour] 	 | 0  				|
		| timestart[minute]  | -5  				|
		| timefinish[day] 	 | 0  				|
		| timefinish[hour]   | +1 				|
		| timefinish[minute] | 0  				|
	And I click on "OK" "button"
	And I press "Save changes"
	And I log out

Scenario: Learner should be able to see the three events with settings overlapping
	whereas one of the event is what they have signed up
	and the other two events came from the setting
	Given I am on a totara site
	And I log in as "bomba"
	And I am on "course1" course homepage
	And I follow "Sign-up"
	When I click on "Sign-up" "button"
	Then I should see "Booked"
	And I should see "Event in progress"
	And I should see "Booking open"
