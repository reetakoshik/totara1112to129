In the notification there are a number of placeholders that can be used, these placeholders will be replaced with the appropriate values when the message is sent.

All place holders are enclosed within square brackets.
There are several types of place holders, the patterns for each are as follows:

* Event details: [placeholder]
* Event custom fields: [session:placeholder]
* Event cancellation custom fields: [sessioncancel:placeholder]
* Multiple session event details: [#sessions][session:placeholder][/sessions]
* Room details for each session: [#sessions][session:room:placeholder][/sessions]
* Room custom fields for each session: [#sessions][session:room:placeholder][/sessions]
* User details: [placeholder]
* User custom fields: [user:placeholder]

You can find out which placeholder are available, and how custom field placeholders work for each type under the relevant heading below.

### 1. Event details

The details of the seminar can be added to the notification by using the desired placeholders from the following list.

* [coursename] - Name of course
* [facetofacename] - Name of seminar activity
* [cost] - Cost of event
* [reminderperiod] - Amount of time before the event that the reminder message is sent
* [sessiondate] - Date of the event the learner is booked on
* [startdate] - Date at the start of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the first one.
* [finishdate] - Date at the end of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the first one.
* [starttime] - Start time of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the first one.
* [finishtime] - Finish time of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the first one.
* [duration] - Length of the event
* [details] - Details about the event
* [attendeeslink] - Link to the attendees page for the event
* [lateststarttime] - Start time of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the last one.
* [lateststartdate] - Date at the start of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the last one.
* [latestfinishtime] - Finish time of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the last one.
* [latestfinishdate] - Date at the end of the event. If there are multiple sessions it will use the last one.
* [registrationcutoff] - The deadline for registrations, if not set this will default to [starttime].
* [booked] - Number of attendees booked for the event
* [capacity] - Total number of seats available in an event
* [mincapacity] - Minimum bookings setting for the event

### 2. Event custom fields

If you have created event custom fields, and wish to use these in your notification body you can do so using the following placeholder, replacing \'placeholder\' with the shortname for the custom field.

    [session:placeholder]

For example if you have an event custom field with the shortname \'department\', to use the value recorded in the custom field in the notification body you would use the placeholder [session:department].

### 3. Event cancellation custom fields

If you have created event cancellation custom fields, and wish to use these in your notification body you can do so using the following placeholder, replacing \'placeholder\' with the shortname for the custom field.

    [sessioncancel:placeholder]

For example if you have an event custom field with the shortname \'cancellationreason\', to use the value recorded in the custom field in the notification body you would use the placeholder [sessioncancel:cancellationreason].

### 4. Multiple session event details

It is possible to include details of each session if you have multiple sessions for an event.
A segment of the notification can be repeated to include the details of each individual session. To do this, add [#sessions] where you would like the loop to start, add [/sessions] where you would like it to end.

You can then add the following placeholders between these tags:

* [session:starttime] - start time of the session.
* [session:startdate] - start date of the session.
* [session:finishtime] - finish time of the session.
* [session:finishdate] - finish date of the session.
* [session:timezone] - timezone of the session.
* [session:duration] - session duration.

### 4.1. Room details for each session

The details of any rooms used for the session can also be added to the notification by using the desired placeholders from the following list.

* [session:room:name] - name of room assigned to this session.
* [session:room:link] - link to details page for this room.

### 4.2. Room custom fields for each session

In addition to the above, room custom field information for each session can be added to the notification by using the following placeholder, replacing \'placeholder\' with the shortname for the custom field.

    [session:room:cf_placeholder]

For example if you have a room custom field with the shortname \'building\', to use the value recorded in the custom field in the notification body you would use the placeholder [session:room:building].

### 5. User details

Available user placeholders:

* [firstname] - User\'s first name
* [lastname] - User\'s last name
* [middlename] - User\'s middle name
* [firstnamephonetic] - Phonetic spelling of the User\'s first name
* [lastnamephonetic] - Phonetic spelling of the User\'s last name
* [alternatename] - Alternate name the user is known by
* [fullname] - User\'s full name

* [institution] - User\'s institution
* [lang] - User\'s language
* [icq] - User\'s ICQ number
* [aim] - User\'s AIM ID
* [msn] - Users\'s MSN ID
* [yahoo] - User\'s Yahoo ID
* [skype] - User\'s Skype ID
* [phone1] - User\'s phone number
* [phone2] - User\'s mobile phone number
* [timezone] - User\'s timezone

### 6. User custom fields

There are also placeholders available for user custom profile fields that can be added to the notification by using the following placeholder, replacing the word placeholder with the user custom profile field shortname:

    [user:placeholder]

For example if you have a user custom profile field with the shortname \'suburb\' that you wish to use in the notification you would [user:suburb] as the placeholder.

### 7. Trusted content

To use placeholders in URL\'s, an admin will need to enable the **Enable trusted content** setting and grant **Trust submitted content** capability to approved roles.';
