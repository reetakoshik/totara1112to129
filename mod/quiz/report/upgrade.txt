* A code refactoring based on new sql functions in MDL-31243 and removing
get_users_by_capability from the quiz reports in MDL-27072. The class
quiz_attempts_report is now initialised to return \core\dml\sql_join (joins,
wheres, params) rather than arrays of userids. This allows the use of joins
in quiz report queries and is very important when there
are larger numbers of enrolled users. The signature of many quiz report
methods now includes '$studentsjoins', rather than '$students' and similar
for '$groupstudentsjoins', '$allowedjoins' and '$usersjoins'. For clear
examples of the use of these changes please see attemptsreport_table.php
base_sql() or almost any function in overview/report.php. The protected
function quiz_attempts_report::load_relevant_students is depreciated,
please use quiz_attempts_report::get_students_joins() instead.
