* mod_quiz_renderer::summary_table() has changed

=== 10 ===

* External functions mod_quiz_external::get_attempt_data, mod_quiz_external::get_attempt_summary
  and mod_quiz_external::get_attempt_review now return additional optional fields:
   - blockedbyprevious: Whether a question is blocked by the previous question.
* quiz_attempt::question_print_comment_fields() has been removed. It was broken
  since at least Moodle 2.0.
* quiz::confirm_start_attempt_message and mod_quiz_view_object::$startattemptwarning
  have been deprecated. This functionality is now entirely handled within the
  quiz access rule plugins.
* The third argument to mod_quiz_renderer::start_attempt_button has been changed
  from a warning string to a mod_quiz_preflight_check_form.
* mod_quiz_renderer::review_next_navigation has a new optional argument. If you
  have overridden that method, consider updating your code to match.
* mod_quiz\output\edit_renderer::start_section_list now takes $structure as an
  argument. If you have overridden this method (it's hard to believe anyone ever
  would) you will need to update your renderer.
* Several methods relating to preview links/buttons/urls have a new optional
  argument to make the preview be of a particular variant.
* mod_quiz_renderer::attempt_navigation_buttons has been changed to output warning text regarding 'next' navigation
  when using 'sequential' navigation method with the addition of a new style 'mod_quiz-next-nav-wrn'.
