* Callback delete_course is deprecated and should be replaced with observer for event \core\event\course_content_deleted
* The report_log_print_graph signature and behaviour has changed to generate charts using
  the new Chart API. The third argument has been renamed to $typeormode and it accepts
  the type (usercourse.png, userday.png) or the mode (today, all).
