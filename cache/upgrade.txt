This files describes API changes in /cache/stores/* - cache store plugins.
Information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 12 ===

* The `cache::now()` function now takes an optional boolean parameter to indicate that the cache should return a more
  accurate time, generated by the PHP `microtime` function.
* Identifiers and invalidation events have been explictly been marked as incompatible and will
  throw a coding exception. Unexpected results would have occurred if the previous behaviour was attempted.
* Identifiers are now part of loaded caches, so identifiers can only be set at cache::make()
  a coding_exception will be thrown if attempts are made at other times.
  Multiple calls to cache::make with different identifiers will produce 2 caches instead of changing the
  keyspace of a single cache.
* The memcache store was removed as it is not compatible with PHP 7.0.

=== 10 ===

* Cache stores has a new feature DEREFERENCES_OBJECTS.
  This allows the cache loader to decide if it needs to handle dereferencing or whether the data
  coming directly to it has already had references resolved.
  - see supports_dereferencing_objects in store.php.
* The following methods have been finally deprecated and should no longer be used.
  - cache_definition::should_be_persistent()
  - cache_definition::get_persistent_max_size()
  - cache::is_using_persist_cache()
  - cache::is_in_persist_cache()
  - cache::get_from_persist_cache()
  - cache::set_in_persist_cache()
  - cache::delete_from_persist_cache()
  - cache_store::cleanup()
* cachestore_dummy::cleanup() has been deprecated.
* cachestore_dummy::instance_deleted() implemented in lieu of cachestore_dummy::cleanup().
* Added cache_store::unit_test_configuration() to calculate unit testing configuration.
* Remove cache_store:initialise_unit_test_instance() as it is incompatible with cache_helper purge functions.
