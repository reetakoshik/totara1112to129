This files describes API changes in HR Import,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 12.0 ===

* Removed deprecated methods:
  * totara_sync_element_user::sync_user_assignments()
  * totara_sync_element_user::sync_user_job_assignments()
  * totara_sync_element_user::sync_user_dependant_job_assignment_fields()
  * totara_sync_element_user::get_invalid_org_pos()
  * totara_sync_element_user::get_invalid_start_end_dates()
  * totara_sync_element_user::get_invalid_roles()
  * totara_sync_element_user::check_self_assignment()
* The following functions now assume empty fields are processed in the source before being passed to the element:
  * sync_item() the third parameter is no longer used. Behaviour of the function has not changed.
  * create_user() the second parameter is no longer used. Behaviour of the function has not changed.
  * set_sync_user_fields the third parameter is no longer used. Behaviour of the function has not changed.
  * put_custom_field_data() the third parameter is no longer used. Behaviour of the function has not changed.
* rb_source_totara_sync_log::rb_display_logtype() has been deprecated, please call tool_totara_sync\rb\display\totara_sync_log_type::display instead().
* Syncing of elements now iterates through each element and runs the whole sync process, including checking for configuration
    errors, the import of data, triggering the event and notifying users, before going to the next element and repeating
    this process
* tool_totara_sync\event\sync_completed now contains a parameter within its 'other' data entry called 'element'. This contains
    the name of the element as returned by the get_name() method.
* When notifying users after completion of element syncing. The users will be notified only of log messages relating to that
  given run of that element, rather than all log messages since the last time users were notified.
* Tasks were added in the tool_totara_sync\task\ namespace which correspond to each element. These will run their individual elements.
* totara_core\task\tool_totara_sync_task is still in place, but this will run any elements that are set to run
    with the default scheduling.
* tool_totara_sync_run has had the first argument added to it, $isscheduledtask, which should be set to true so that only
    elements set to run on the default scheduled task are run.
* save_scheduled_task_from_form has had an optional second argument added to it, $task. This is to be set if you wish to save
    data against a task other than the default.
* totara_sync_notify has been deprecated. Elements should be run via totara_sync_element::run_sync(), which will notify users following the run.
    Alternatively, the protected method totara_sync_element::notify_user can perform this operation.
* The base source class now uses the element property in its constructor. In extended source classes, it is now recommended
    to assign a value to $this->element before calling parent::construct().

=== 11.0 ===

* Notifications and source field information has been moved out Element forms, affecting mark-up in the following methods:
  * csv_trait::config_form_add_csv_details()
  * totara_sync_source_org_csv::config_form()
  * totara_sync_source_pos_csv::config_form()
  * totara_sync_source_user_csv::config_form()
  * database_trait::totara_sync_source_org_database()
  * totara_sync_source_org_database::config_form()
  * totara_sync_source_pos_database::config_form()
  * totara_sync_source_user_database::config_form()
