  Scenario: Check the effect of changing the create option for the user element.

    # Check that the firstname and lastname fields are included in the import.
    # When 'create' is allowed, these should be automatically included as part
    # of the import fields.
    Given I navigate to "CSV" node in "Site administration > HR Import > Sources > User"
    Then I should see "\"firstname\",\"lastname\""
    And I should not see "import_firstname" in the "#id_importheader" "css_element"
