* Admin settings have been refined to better support right-to-left languages. In RTL,
  most fields should not have their direction flipped, a URL, a path to a file, ...
  are always displayed LTR. The admin setting will now best guess if they should be
  RTLized based on their PARAM_* type. To override that guess, use
  admin_setting::set_force_ltr(true/false).
