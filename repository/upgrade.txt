=== 10 ===

* The method repository::uses_post_requests() has been deprecated and must not be used anymore.
* The alfresco repository has been moved to the plugins database. It was
  using an older version of the Alfresco SDK which is not compatible with recent versions of Alfresco.
* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available
  anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-51580 for more info:
    - repository_picasa_admin_upgrade_notification()
    - repository_googledocs_admin_upgrade_notification()
    - repository_boxnet_admin_upgrade_notification()
    - repository_alfresco_admin_security_key_notice()
* The prepare_file() function will now return a file in a per-request directory which will
  be automatically cleaned at the end of the request.
  No modifications should be required as a result of this change.
