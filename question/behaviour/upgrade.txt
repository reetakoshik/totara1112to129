1) The standard behaviours that use a 'Check' button have all been changed so
   that they only show the button when the question is active. Your behaviour
   may inherit this behaviour, because the change was made in the base class,
   and this is probably good for consistency. However, if your question behaviour
   uses the Check button, your probably want to test it carefully, and you will
   probably have to update your unit tests. See MDL-53304 for more details.
