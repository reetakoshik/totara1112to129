This files describes API changes for the core question engine,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 12.5 ===

* When a question is displayed, the outer div of the question has an id="q123" added.
  Unfortunately, this id was not unique in all cases when a question was rendered on
  a page. Therefore, get_outer_question_div_unique_id() has been added to generate a
  unique id. In any custom question type "'q' . $qa->get_slot()" needs to be replaced
  by a call to this method.

  core_question_renderer::question() has now been updated to use this new method.
