* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available
  anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-51580 for more info:
    - qtype_essay_convert_to_html()

  then you must now pass $args as the 4th argument, so the correct permission checks
  can be performed. If you don't, you will get a developer debug notice.
