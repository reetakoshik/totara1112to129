  @javascript
  Scenario: Move a question between categories via the question page
    When I navigate to "Questions" node in "Course administration > Question bank"
    Then I should see "Also show questions from subcategories"

    # Collapse
    When I click on "Search options" "text"
    Then I should not see "Also show questions from subcategories"

    # Expand
    When I click on "Search options" "text"
    Then I should see "Also show questions from subcategories"
