* customfield_get_fields function has been deprecated, this function was used only in one place and duplicated the functionality of customfield_get_data.
* customfield_base::_constructor added $suffix parameter that allows for custom suffixes to avoid name collisions
  If you have implemented any classes based on customfield_base which override the default __constructor function 
  then you should add the '$suffix = null' parameter and pass it to the parent::__constructor()
  to ensure that the custom field type is not affected by the uniqueness problem addressed in TL-16499. See totara/customfield/field/checkbox/field.class.php for an example.
* customfield_definition added $suffix parameter that allows for custom suffixes to avoid name collisions
* customfield_load_data added $suffix parameter that allows loading data for fields with custom suffixes
