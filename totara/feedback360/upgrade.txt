* New database field requestertoken added to the feedback360_resp_assignment table.
This is will hold sha1 hashes unique to each response. If the user who requested feedback is viewing responses,
the response should be queried via this value, particularly if anonymous feedback is used.
When a user that has requested feedback views a response, a 'responseid' in the url can no longer
be used to fetch feedback, they must use the 'requestertoken'. This does not apply to users who are
submitting feedback.
* Reduced specificy of CSS selectors to improve RTL support
* Renamed CSS class "previewer" to "feedback360-previewer" so that it did not clash with the same CSS class in appraisals
* Altered the renderer display_feedback_header()
* Altered the renderer display_preview_feedback_header()
* New database field selfevaluation added to the feedback360 table.
  This will be used for self evaluation to specify if it is disabled, optional or required for each feedback template.
  This will be used for self evaluation to record if the user has declined the feedback.
* The feedback360::get_available_forms() has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version.
* The request_select_form class has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version.
