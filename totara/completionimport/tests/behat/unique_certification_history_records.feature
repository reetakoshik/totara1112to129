Feature: Certification history can be imported as long as records are considered unique
  Uploaded history records respect the certification history uniqueness rules
  Allowing an admin to create valid data

Scenario: Certification history records are added where due date matches and completion does not
  Given I am on a totara site
  And the following "users" exist:
    | username | firstname  | lastname  | email                |
    | learner1 | Learner    | One       | learner1@example.com |

    | fullname          | shortname | idnumber |
    | Certification One | cert1     | 1        |

  # Follow-up test. This test window opening rather than completion import itself, but is mostly an issue for
  # data that would have been imported, so is useful to test here.
  # We create a current completion where the window will open on next cron run and ensure that none of the
  # completion dates are overwritten
