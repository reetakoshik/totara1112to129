  Scenario: Calendar navigation when dashboard set as homepage works correctly
    Given I log in as "admin"
    # Add the calendar block to the site front page.
    And I navigate to "Dashboards" node in "Site administration > Appearance"
    # Add a dashboard.
    And I press "Create dashboard"

    And I log out
    When I log in as "student1"

    And I should see "Calendar" in the ".block_calendar_month .title" "css_element"
    And I click on "Previous month" "link" in the ".minicalendar .calendar-controls" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Calendar" in the ".block_calendar_month .title" "css_element"
