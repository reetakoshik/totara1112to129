  Scenario: Delete individual position setting
    Given I am on a totara site
    And the following "position frameworks" exist in "totara_hierarchy" plugin:
      | idnumber | fullname    |
      | fw1      | framework 1 |
    And the following "positions" exist in "totara_hierarchy" plugin:
      | idnumber | fullname | pos_framework |
      | 1        | Pos 1    | fw1           |
      | 2        | Pos 2    | fw1           |
      | 3        | Pos 3    | fw1           |
      | 4        | Pos 4    | fw1           |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Audiences" node in "Site administration > Audiences"

    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name | test audience |
      | Type | Dynamic       |
