    And the following "cohorts" exist:
        | name | idnumber |

    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |

      | Course 2 | C2 | 0 |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following administration settings values:
      | Enable audience-based visibility | 1 |
