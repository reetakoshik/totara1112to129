* rb_display_certif_status has been moved in to a new style auto-loading class
  display function (\totara_certification\rb\display\certif_status) to use this class
  $this->usedcomponents[] = 'totara_certification'; must be set in the constructor for
  report source.
* certif_create_completion added third optional parameter $message which will be added to the start of relevant logs
* certif_create_completion now creates the prog_completion record when the record is missing, rather than giving an error
* certif_create_completion now deletes "expired" certif_completion_history records when they are used to reassign a user
* certification_event_handler::unassigned() is deprecated. Call certif_conditionally_delete_completion directly instead.
* delete_removed_users() is deprecated. This functionality is already performed in existing Totara code.
* totara_certification_renderer::get_completion_checker_results has been changed - the $data parameter now requires
  fulllist, aggregatelist and totalcount.
