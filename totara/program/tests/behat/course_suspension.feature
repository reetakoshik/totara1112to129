Feature: Suspend and re-enrol users enrolled in courses via programs
  In order to ensure that users enrolled in courses via programs have only access to the intended courses
  We must verify that suspension works properly for all program enrolment methods
  We must also verify that the user is being unsuspended if re-assigned to the program
