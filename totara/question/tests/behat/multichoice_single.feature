Feature: Admin interface of single answer multichoice question
  In order to create a multichoice question for feedback360 and appraisals
  I need to ensure correct behaviour of the admin interface

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Manage Feedback" node in "Site administration > Appraisals"
    And I click on "Create Feedback" "button"
    And I set the field "Name" to "test feedback"
    And I click on "Create Feedback" "button"
    And I switch to "Content" tab
    And I set the field "datatype" to "Multiple choice (one answer)"
    And I click on "Add" "button"
    And I set the field "Question" to "Test question 1"
    And I set the field "choice[0][option]" to "one"
    And I set the field "choice[1][option]" to "two"
    And I set the field "choice[2][option]" to "three"
    When I click on "Make selected by default" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    Then I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"

  Scenario: totara_question 101: Make default link
    Given I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    When I click on "Make selected by default" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    Then I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    And I should not see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"

  Scenario: totara_question 102: Unselect link
    When I click on "unselect" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    Then I should not see "unselect" in the "#id_availablechoices" "css_element"
    And I should see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"

  Scenario: totara_question 103: Add more link
    Given I click on "Add another option" "link"
    And I set the field "choice[3][option]" to "three"

    When I click on "Make selected by default" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_3" "css_element"
    Then I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_3" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_3" "css_element"
    And I should see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    And I should not see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    And I should see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_0" "css_element"
    And I should not see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_0" "css_element"

  Scenario: totara_question 104: Javascript works after reload
    Given I click on "Save changes" "button"
    # Accessibility for this link is a bit naf
    And I click on "Settings" "link" in the ".feedback360-quest-actions" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    And I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    When I click on "Make selected by default" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    Then I should see "unselect" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    And I should see "Make selected by default" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_1" "css_element"

    When I click on "unselect" "link" in the "#fgroup_id_choice_2" "css_element"
    Then I should not see "unselect" in the "#id_availablechoices" "css_element"
