* Added field totarasync to the comp table
* The method hierarchy::download_ods has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_ods_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_xls has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
use hierarchy::download_xls_legacy, which is public.
* The method hierarchy::download_csv has had its scope changed from public to protected. To continue using the previous behaviour,
  use hierarchy::download_csv_legacy, which is public.
* The scheduled task update_competency_task did not scale so it had to be refactored. The refactoring breaks backwards compatibility
  for the method competency_cron_aggregate_evidence(). This method was replaced by a new method called aggregate_competency_evidence_items() which behaviour
  is different to the previous one. Previously there was one big query and loop which went through all competency/user combinations.
  Now all evidence items for a particular user and framework/depth combination are loaded and then passed to this method for aggregation.
  Additionally the method competency_cron_evidence_items() was replaced with a private method run_evidence_type_aggregation_methods(). The old method was deprecated
  in favour of the new one.
