    And I press "Go"
    Then I should see "org1"
    And I should see "Type: orgtype1"
    And I should see "textinput1fullname: value1"
    # Others skipped, checked above
    And I should see "textinput17fullname: value17"
    # Others skipped, checked above
    And I should see "textinput61fullname: value61"
