Frontpage combo list block
==========================

The frontpage combolist block was introduced in Totara 12 as part of a move to preserve
backwards compatibility when converting frontpage content to a new centre block region.
It performs the functionality of the old combo list, and category list.

This block is deprecated already. It was only introduced for backwards compatibility.
It is disabled by default in new installations, and only enabled on upgrade
if either the combo list or category list frontpage widgets were in use.

This block will be removed from Totara 13.
