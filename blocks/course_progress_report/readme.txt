Course progress report block
============================

The Course progress report block was introduced in Totara 12 as part of a move to preserve
backwards compatibility when converting frontpage content to a new centre block region.
It performs the functionality of the Course progress frontpage setting.

This block is deprecated already. It was only introduced for backwards compatibility.
It is disabled by default in new installations, and only enabled on upgrade if the
Course progress setting was enabled.

This block will be removed from Totara 13.
