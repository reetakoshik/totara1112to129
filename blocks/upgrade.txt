* Introduced block_edit_form::has_common_settings() method to allow custom blocks to turn new settings off.
  Please note, that new settings are not built on top of the existing configuration model. Even if a third-party block already has the settings such as title override or similar
  the common settings will be an extra layer of override, which is disabled by default. Essentially that should not interfere with the existing functionality,
  the worst case scenario it will be duplicated. However implementing has_common_settings() method will allow third party blocks to opt out of using custom settings.
