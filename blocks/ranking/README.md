Moodle Ranking block repository
===============================

This block improves gamefication into the moodle plataform.

The ranking block works together with the moodle course completion. In the moodle course you configure the criterias to the end of the course. The ranking block monitors these activities and add points to the students based on accomplishing the activities. There are different ways to gain points.

For example:
 * If a student completes a html page the ranking adds 2 points.
 * If a student completes an assignment and it is ended only when the student receive a grade. The ranking add 2 points plus the grade points to the student. You can configure the default points in the block configuraion.

> **NOTE**: All the activities that needs grade to be finished will add the activity points (default 2) more the activity grade. For example: If the course has one assignment and it's configured to be completed only after the grade is received by the student and let's say a random student received by the end of the assignment 10(ten) as his grade. In this case that student will obtain 12(twelve) points, the 2(two pre-configured) from finishing the activity plus 10(ten) from his grade.

>**This only occurs with activities that have grades. ex: foruns, assignments, lessons, etc...**
