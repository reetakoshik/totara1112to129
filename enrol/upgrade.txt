* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now return the category id as an additional optional field.
* core_enrol_external::get_enrolled_users now supports two additional parameters for ordering: sortby and sortdirection.
* Enrolment plugins UI have been consolidated. Plugins can implement use_standard_editing_ui() function
  and add edit_instance_form() and edit_instance_validation() methods instead of providing their own edit.php and form.
  They can then rely on the default implementation of get_action_icons and get_course_navigation. In future this will
  mean they can be called by webservices/user upload tools because they can validate their data.
